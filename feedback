Oct 1: I'm not seeing your data files or R script. And it doesn't look like you have the data/wrangling/documents/graphics etc. folder 
structure here, although I know you said you changed to it. Can you upload these for me? Thanks!

Dec 3: Folder structure looks pretty good. I don't see a raw data folder, but I have a slight recollection that you don't have raw data - 
is that right? Also, your ppt, dmp, analysis_outline can all go in docs.
